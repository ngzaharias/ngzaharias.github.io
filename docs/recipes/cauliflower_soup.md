### Cauliflower Soup

## Ingredients
* 1 large head cauliflower, chopped into florets
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* Fine sea salt
* 1 medium red onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
* 4 cups (32 ounces) vegetable broth
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or more if needed
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celcius.
2. Toss cauliflower with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large bowl. Arrange the cauliflower in a single layer on a baking tray and sprinkle lightly with salt. 
3. Place in the oven and bake until the cauliflower is tender and caramelized on the edges, 25 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway.
4. Once the cauliflower is almost done, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then add the broth.
6. Transfer the cauliflower to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, to give the flavors time to meld.
7. Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
8. Add the souper to the blender and add the butter and blend until smooth. Add the lemon juice and nutmeg and blend again. Add additional salt, to taste.
