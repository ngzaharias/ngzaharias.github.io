'Jetpack Joyride' is a endless runner game for mobile & tablet that was developed using C++ and an in-house game engine. During my time their as a Gameplay Programmer I worked on a large variety of systems and gameplay elements across multiple SKUs:

SKUs: iOS, tvOS, Android, Amazon and Amazon Underground
Integrated stickers into Jetpack for the launch and featuring of Apple's iOS 10
Designed and implemented multiple game-play events that become automatically available to users based on an event calendar, these included Bling It On, Cut & Run, Zappy Bird, Christmas, Halloween and 'Back to the Future'
Created targeted mediation for advertisement and special offers through the use of a noticeboard in the results screen and a pop-up in the title screen that are only presented to users based on certain conditions
Rolled out various split-tests to Android users to help in guiding the direction of the product and new features
Maintained and refactored an older code base whenever there were changes in requirements or technology being used in the project, including ad-mediation services and platform specific features
