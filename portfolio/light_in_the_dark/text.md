'Light In The Dark' is a puzzle game for mobile & tablet that was developed using C# and the Unity game engine. Starting their in August 2014 for a 5 month contract as a Gameplay Programmer I worked on a variety of systems, features and most predominately on new mechanics for the content pack 'Aztec Ruins':

SKUs: iOS and Android
Prototyping: New mechanics was a big part of the content pack as new gameplay features were needed to keep the game engaging with the Ghost Light, Ghost Objects, Portals and the Sponge Light (all pictured above) being chosen
Content Pack: A content pack for the existing game that has all an all new theme, levels and gameplay features
