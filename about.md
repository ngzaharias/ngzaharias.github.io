Hey there, my name is Nicholas and I make games.

I started programming back in 2012 at the same time I was finishing up my final year of teaching. I fell in love with programming after doing a short course and signed up for an Advanced Diploma at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Canberra, Australia. There I learnt a broad range of skills and languages focused on game development, specifically C++ and C#.  Just before graduating I had the chance to begin working in the game industry at Dreamgate Studios as well as teaching C++ and C# at AIE.

At Dreamgate Studios I was employed as a Junior Programmer working on their mobile title 'Light In The Dark' using C# and the Unity Engine. During my time there I worked with a small team of programmers, artists and designers to create a content pack called 'Aztec Ruins'. 

After Canberra I was offered a job in Brisbane, Australia to go and work at Halfbrick Studios as an Associate Programmer on their leading title 'Jetpack Joyride'. I worked with The Rocketeers team on multiple game-play updates that includes both the 'Back To The Future' and 'Halloween' event. In conjunction with this I worked on general game systems such as the event calendar, split-tests for Android users, integrating advertisement and mediation of special offers to players.

Currently I'm living in Quebec City, Canada working at Larian Studios as a Gameplay Programmer where I helped release their critically acclaimed title, Divinity: Original Sin 2. Whilst continuing to provide support and updates for it, I'm also working on an exciting new unannounced project where I'm taking on a more focused role in locomotion, networking and pathfinding.

In my spare time I love to work on prototypes and game technology with a special interest in shaders, virtual reality with the HTC Vive and the Unreal 4 game engine. I am also an avid swing dancer, board gamer and recently just started delving into bookbinding.
