### Cauliflower Cottage Pie

## Ingredients
* 500g ground beef
* 600g cauliflower
* 120g green peas
* 2 potatos
* 2 carrots
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 yellow onion
* 2 tablespoons flour
* pinch garlic salt
* pinch onion powder

## Instructions
1. Preheat the broiler to high.
2. Add 10 1/2 cups water and 1 tbsp salt to a large pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
3. Peel, then cut potato into 1-inch pieces. Peel, then cut the onion into 1/4-inch pieces. Peel, then grate the carrot. Peel, then mince or grate garlic.
4. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil, then garlic, onions, carrots, peas and beef. Cook, breaking up beef into smaller pieces, until no pink remains, 4-5 min. Stir in broth concentrate, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 cup water. Season with pepper. Bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring often, until filling thickens slightly, 3-5 min.
5. Meanwhile, add cauliflower and potatoes to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 9-10 min. Drain and return cauliflower and potatoes to the same pot, off heat. Roughly mash sour cream and 4 tbsp butter into cauliflower and potatoes until slightly creamy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
6. Transfer beef filling to an 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with mashed cauliflower and potatoes, then spread into an even layer. Broil in the middle of the oven until mash is golden-brown on top, 5-6 min.
