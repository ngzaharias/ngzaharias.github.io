### German Apple Pie

## Ingredients
* 125g butter
* 90g sugar
* 1 cup self raising flour
* 1 egg
* 3 cooking apples, thinly sliced
* ½ cup of sultanas
* 1 tablespoon raw sugar
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg

## Pastry
1. Melt butter in a saucepan, add sugar and stir until it is beginning to dissolve.
2. Add flour and stir well and then beat in an egg. The final result should still be oiling and you can touch without it sticking to fingers.

## Filling
1. Preheat oven to 180°C.
2. Grease a pan and cover in a small layer of flour. Take a bit more than ½ of the pastry and spread it across the bottom of the pan.
3. Mix sultanas, raw sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg together in a small bowl.
4. Add in ½ of the apples of top of the layer of pastry and cover them in ½ of the sultana sugar mix, add the rest of the apples and then add the rest of the mixture.
5. Add the remainder of the pastry to the top of the last layer in small amounts (try and spread them around evenly).
6. Bake in oven for 35-45 minutes.
