### Blueberry Lemon Cake

## Ingredients
* 1½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 eggs
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoons fresh grated lemon zest
* 2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* ½ cup milk
* 1 cup fresh blueberries
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C.
2. Combine together dry ingredients.
3. Combine butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, lemon.
4. Add milk and dry ingredients (alternating).
5. Toss blueberries in flour (This will help them not to be evenly dispursed, I like to do this in a collander to allow even coating).
6. Quickly fold the blueberries into the mix and immediately place in a 350 degree preheated oven.
7. Bake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
