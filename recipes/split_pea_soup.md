## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 3 cups water
* 1 pound ham steak, skin removed, cut into quarters (see note)
* 3 slices (4 oz) thick-cut bacon, left whole (see note)
* 1 pound green split peas (about 2 cups), picked through and rinsed
* 3 sprigs fresh thyme, plus more for serving
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 medium carrots, cut into ½-inch pieces
* 1 medium celery rib, cut into ¼-inch pieces

## Instructions
1. Heat the butter in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Do not brown.
2. Add the broth, water, ham steak, bacon, peas, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring frequently to keep the peas from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the peas are tender but not falling apart, about 45 minutes.
3. Remove the ham steak and place it on a plate; cover with foil and set aside. Stir in the carrots and celery and continue to simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender and the peas have almost completely broken down, about 30 minutes longer.
4. Meanwhile, shred the ham steak into small bite-size pieces with two forks. Cover with foil again.
5. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and bacon slices. Add the shredded ham to the soup and return to a simmer. Add a few grinds of pepper, then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
